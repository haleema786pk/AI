A star algorithem is implemented in aStar.py by converting a graph into python Dictionary

Genetic algorithem is implemented to solve 4 Queen puzzle problem.
4 Queen puzzle problem says that no 2 or more queens on board are placed such that they can attack each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally. board is given in the form of a 2-d list in python. A limitation here is that while entering queen's position they can be parallel horizontally but not vertically.

heuristic1.py and manhat_dis.py are hueristic based searching algorithems. Here these methods are used to solve a simple board arrangemnet problem 3x3 board starting 1 from index 00 and 8 ending at index 21. manhatten distance is used to compute hueristic value of board  where as in heuristic1.py heuristic cost is computed by simply just counting numbers of misplaced tiles(numbers).
